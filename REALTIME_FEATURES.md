|-------|-------------|------|
| `join` | Join a specific room | `room` (string) |
| `leave` | Leave a specific room | `room` (string) |
| `typing:start` | Start typing indicator | `room` (string) |
| `typing:stop` | Stop typing indicator | `room` (string) |
| `notification:read` | Mark notification as read | `notificationId` |
| `analytics:subscribe` | Subscribe to analytics updates | - |

### Server ‚Üí Client Events

| Event | Description | Data |
|-------|-------------|------|
| `notification` | New notification | `notification` object |
| `internship:created` | New internship posted | `internship` object |
| `internship:updated` | Internship updated | `internship` object |
| `internship:deleted` | Internship deleted | `internshipId` |

## Testing Real-time Features

### 1. Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Multi-user Testing
- Open multiple browser tabs/windows
- Login with different user roles (student, company, admin)
- Test real-time features:
  - Create internships (company) ‚Üí notifications (students)
  - Submit applications (student) ‚Üí notifications (company)
  - Update application status (company) ‚Üí notifications (student)
  - View real-time analytics (admin)

## Performance Considerations

1. **Connection Management**
   - Automatic reconnection on disconnect
   - Connection pooling for multiple tabs
   - Memory cleanup on disconnect

2. **Event Throttling**
   - Analytics updates are throttled to prevent spam
   - User activity tracking is debounced

3. **Room Management**
   - Users automatically join relevant rooms
   - Efficient room-based broadcasting
   - Automatic cleanup on disconnect

## Security Features

1. **Authentication**
   - JWT token validation for socket connections
   - User verification on each socket event
   - Role-based event access control

2. **Data Validation**
   - Input validation for all socket events
   - Sanitization of real-time data
   - Rate limiting for socket events

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Socket Connection Failed**
   - Check JWT token validity
   - Verify CORS configuration
   - Ensure backend server is running

2. **Real-time Updates Not Working**
   - Check socket connection status
   - Verify user is in correct rooms
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor connection count
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Optimize event frequency

### Debug Commands

```javascript
// Check socket connection status
socketService.getConnectionStatus()

// View connected users (admin only)
socketService.emit('get_connected_users')

// Test notification
socketService.emit('test_notification', { message: 'Test' })
```
